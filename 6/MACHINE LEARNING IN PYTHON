Macchine Learning in Python


To my children,Scott,Seth,and Cayley. THeir blossoming lives and selves bring me more joy than anythiong else in the world.

To my close friends David and Ron for their selfless generosity and steadfast friendship. 

To my friends and colleagues at Hacker Dojo in Mountain View, California, for their technical challenges and repartee.

To my climbing partners. One of them, Katherine, says climbing partners make the best friends because "they see you paralyzed with fear, offer encouragement to overcome it, cnd celebrate when you do."

About the Technical Editor 
--------------------------

Daniel Posner holds Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Economics and is completing a PH.D. in Biostatistics at Biston University. He has provided statistical consultation for pharmaceutical and biotech ad well as for researches at the Palo Alto VA hospital.
Daniel has collaborated with the author extensively on topics covered in this book. In the past, they have written grant proposals to develop web=scale gradient booktinh algorithms. Most recently, they worked together on a consulting contract involving random forests and spline basis expansions to identitg key variables in drug trial outcomes and to sharpen predications in order to reduce the required trial populations.

Acknowledgments
---------------


I'd like to acknowledge the splendid support that people at Wiley have offered during the course of writing this book. It began with Robert Elliot, the acquisitions editor, who first contacted me about writing a book; he was very easy to work with. It continued with Jennifer Lynn, who has done the editing on the book. She's been very responsive to questions and very patiently kept me on schedule during the writing. I thank you both. 
I also want to acknowledge the enormous comfort that comes from having such a sharp, thorough statistician and programmer as Daniel Posner doing the technical editing on the book. Thank you for that and thanks also for the fun and interesting discussions on machien learning, statistics, and algorithms. I don't know anyone else who'll get as deep as fast.
